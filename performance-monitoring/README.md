## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Microsoft Intune subscription with advanced monitoring features
- PowerShell 7.0 or later (recommended)
- Azure Monitor workspace (for cloud integration)
- Appropriate permissions for performance monitoring
- Network connectivity for monitoring endpoints

### Quick Setup

1. **Configure Monitoring Environment**:
   ```powershell
   # Initialize performance monitoring environment
   .\setup\Initialize-PerformanceMonitoring.ps1 -TenantId "your-tenant-id"
   ```

2. **Deploy Monitoring Agents**:
   ```powershell
   # Deploy performance monitoring to target devices
   .\deployment\Deploy-MonitoringAgents.ps1 -DeviceGroup "All Devices"
   ```

3. **Start Monitoring Services**:
   ```powershell
   # Start real-time performance monitoring
   .\monitoring-dashboards\system-performance-dashboard.ps1 -StartMonitoring
   ```

4. **Configure Alerting**:
   ```powershell
   # Set up performance alerting
   .\alerting-system\threshold-monitor.ps1 -ConfigureThresholds
   ```

## Configuration

### Monitoring Thresholds

```powershell
# CPU Performance Thresholds
$CPUThresholds = @{
    Warning = 70    # CPU usage > 70%
    Critical = 85   # CPU usage > 85%
    Sustained = 60  # Sustained high usage duration (minutes)
}

# Memory Performance Thresholds
$MemoryThresholds = @{
    Warning = 80    # Memory usage > 80%
    Critical = 90   # Memory usage > 90%
    LowMemory = 15  # Available memory < 15%
}

# Disk Performance Thresholds
$DiskThresholds = @{
    Warning = 75    # Disk usage > 75%
    Critical = 90   # Disk usage > 90%
    IOLatency = 100 # Disk I/O latency > 100ms
}
```

### Reporting Configuration

```powershell
# Automated Reporting Settings
$ReportingConfig = @{
    Schedule = "Daily"              # Daily, Weekly, Monthly
    Recipients = @("admin@company.com", "it-team@company.com")
    Format = "HTML"                 # HTML, PDF, Excel
    DetailLevel = "Executive"       # Executive, Detailed, Technical
    RetentionDays = 90             # Report retention period
}
```

## Best Practices

### Monitoring Strategy
- Establish performance baselines before implementing changes
- Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) consistently
- Set up graduated alerting thresholds (warning, critical)
- Regularly review and adjust monitoring thresholds
- Implement monitoring for both reactive and proactive management

### Performance Optimization
- Address performance issues promptly when identified
- Implement performance improvements gradually
- Monitor the impact of optimization changes
- Maintain performance optimization documentation
- Regular performance review meetings

### Data Management
- Implement appropriate data retention policies
- Ensure monitoring data is securely stored
- Regular backup of performance monitoring configurations
- Archive historical performance data appropriately
- Maintain monitoring system performance itself

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High CPU Usage in Monitoring Scripts**
   - Reduce monitoring frequency
   - Optimize script performance
   - Implement batch processing

2. **Network Connectivity Issues**
   - Check firewall configurations
   - Verify monitoring endpoints
   - Test network latency

3. **Insufficient Monitoring Data**
   - Verify agent deployment
   - Check monitoring permissions
   - Review data collection settings
